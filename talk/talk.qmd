## New developments

- Renewal grant approved for funding (2023-2028)
- Migration from AWS to GCP
    - Improved performance, easier scaling, and lower cost per dataset
    - Open datasets still shared via AWS Public Datasets
- Improved performance for large datasets (now handling 2TB+)
- Published data retention/admin policies for reference in Data Sharing Plans
- Links to NEMAR for supported datasets
- Initial support for ORCID integration
- Support for fNIRS upload


## Schema-based validation for BIDS

- OpenNeuro data ingestion relies upon JavaScript BIDS validator
- Original validator built the standard structure directly into the validator code
    - Made addition of new data types quite laborious
    - JavaScript expertise is relatively rare in our community
- Work began in 2021 on defining the standard separately using a schema that 
  - Multiple sprints involving the OpenNeuro team, NIMH Data Science and Sharing team, and others
- Very nearly ready go live on OpenNeuro


## Sharing of derivative datasets

- Derivative data (e.g. preprocessed MRI data) are now supported through the BIDS-Derivatives extension (developed under BRAIN R24MH114705)
- One major motivation for the schema-based validator was to support the validation of derivative datasets
- In advance of this, we have been developing support for sharing of derivative datasets within OpenNeuro

## Preprocessing/QC of OpenNeuro fMRI datasets

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- All human fMRI datasets from OpenNeuro are being run through MRIQC and fMRIPrep
    - Via a Pathways allocation on the TACC Frontera supercomputer
- To date:
    - 229/430 datasets successfully run with MRIQC
    - 65/430 successfully preprocessed with fMRIPrep
- Derivatives openly available via S3 or Datalad

## Alignment with new NIH Data Sharing Policy

::: {.absolute top=20% left=0% style="font-size: 1.25em; text-align: left;"}
"we highlight the importance of researchers considering whether, in choosing where and how to make their data available (if not already specified by an FOA or funding NIH ICO expectation), access to scientific data derived from humans should be controlled, even if de-identified and lacking explicit limitations on subsequent use...SACHRP identified concerns regarding re-identification of otherwise de-identified data, and indeed technological advances and increasing interoperability among data resources, while providing opportunities for new analyses, present identifiability concerns that are widely acknowledged."

## Potential solution

- We are considering adding a click-through agreement for all users requiring agreement to not attempt reidentification
- This would cause friction because automated download would require an API key for each user
    - vs. unauthenticated downloads from S3/datalad at present

## Neuroethics supplement

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- A neuroethics supplement has supported Dr. Annie Jwa, a legal scholar with expertise in neuroethics
- Jwa & Poldrack (2022, Journal of Law and the Biosciences) argued for development of regulatory protections against misuse of neuroscience data
    - "Neuroscience Information Non-discrimination Act"
- With funding from Stanford HAI, we are working with Sanmi Koyejo to examine potential for adversarial perturbations of structural MRI data to disable reidentification attempts
